=====================

# Contents

This repo contains:

* code samples (/code)
* data (/data) 

# How do I run this code?

From the root of the repo run your favorite basic http server.
I'm a fan of `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

# I Don't see anything

That's because some of the output is in the console. 
You should pop that open and try again.

# Do I have to run this code?

No. The following examples (sorted in order of slide progression) also have jsBins you can view:

# Is this production level code?

Hah! Funny. Nope. I didn't architect any proper apps here. Use these code samples as guides, but please get to know the libraries well enough to judge them yourself before you use them.

# I have questions you haven't answered here

Great. Ping me at @ireneros on twitter or irene at bocoup.com.
I also idle in many places on irc: #bocoup, #misoproject.
